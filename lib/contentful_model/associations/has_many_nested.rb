        # has_many_nested allows you to set up a tree relationship
        # it calls has_many and belongs_to_many on the class, and sets up
        # some methods to find a deeply-nested instance's parents
        #
        # To set this up in contentful, add a multi-entry field validated to the same model
        # as the parent, and give it a name. For example, Page might have a field called childPages:
        #
        # has_many_nested :child_pages, root: -> { Page.find("some_id") }
        #
        # would setup up an instance attribute called parent_pages which lists all the direct
        # parents of this page. It would also create methods to find a page based on an array
        # of its ancestors, and generate an array of ancestors. Note that this builds an array of the
        # ancestors which called the object; because 'many' associations in Contentful are actually
        # 'belongs_to_many' from the child end, we might have several ancestors to a page. You will need
        # to write your own recursion for this, because it's probably an implementation-specific problem.
